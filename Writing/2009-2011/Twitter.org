Never know how much I follow\\
Never know how much I care\\
When you're tweeting something jokey\\
I want re-tweet it, it's so hard to bare\\
I want to tweet it\\
When girl kissed me\\
Tweet it when I had a sex\\
Twitter!\\
In the morning\\
Twitter all through the night\\
Google Reader in a daytime\\
Yeah Playstation in the night\\
I light up when someone's tweets me\\
You know I'm gonna tweet them back\\
I have to tweet it\\
When it's earthquake\\
Tweet it though don't know the place\\
Tweet it\\
Steve leaves Apple\\
Tweet it: Motorola bought\\


Everybody's got a twitter\\
That is something you all know\\
Twitter isn't such a new thing\\
Twitter started long ago\\
(in 2K6 by the way)\\


Apple produced an iPad\\
iPad was a new iPhone\\
When I put my arms in iPad\\
I open Twitter got my mind in flame\\
The precious twitter!\\
When it launched\\
Twitter with this nice blue style\\
Twitter!\\
Rainbow twitter\\
Twitter hey you were so sooth\\


When I lounging in my bedroom\\
Slugging in my lovely bed\\
Sitting in cafe with Wi-Fi\\
I'm launching Twitter and I feel I came\\
The holy twitter!\\
You're so hottie!\\
Twitter is my lovely friend\\
Twitter!\\
Holy twitter\\
Twitter always treats you right\\


Now you've listened to my story\\
Is the ... I have made\\
Twitter has Barack Obama\\
Twitter hasn't Sasha Grey\\
They in a Twitter!\\
and you also\\
Twitter makes you very known\\
Tweet things!\\
'Till you sizzle\\
What a lovely waste of time\\
What a lovely waste of time\\
What a lovely waste of time\\

(2011)
