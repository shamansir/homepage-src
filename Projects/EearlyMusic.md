# Early Music

I compose music since around 2003, still I don't have any musical degree. I used FruityLoops mostly at the time and much later, when there an iPad was invented, I started using NanoStudio and then Nanostudio 2. Nowadays I own the Ableton Suite and Ableton Push 3 and several groove boxes, but it's a story for a different page.

Most of my tracks are published on SoundCloud and some are compiled and published to services like Spotify:
