# Summary

My real name is **Anton Kotenko**.

Definitely a geek and kind of musician and kind of VJ. I was born in _Saint-Petersburg, Russia_ in March of 1984 :snowflake:, at my age of 24 I moved to _Odessa, Ukraine_ :ukraine: and after living there for a few years (lovely city and people[^1]), I moved to _Munich, Germany_ :mountain_bicyclist: in 2012, which turned out to be just a perfect city for living. For work and leisure.

I work as a software/frontend developer starting from 2003 which makes me 20+ years being in this shit and I still really love it! :). You can find my complete [[Lebenslauf]] here, which is the German word for _'How my life runs'_ or _'The story of my life'_ or _'How my life was ruined'_ as well. Also below is the list of my other passions, I mean, other than programming.

I prefer to mix these passions together sometimes, so that even some of my latest work responsibilities included something artistic: like, writing JS Player for [Animatron](https://www.animatron.com/) project, which is now called Animatron Studio. And, in [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com) we formed a team of [Computational Arts](https://cai.jetbrains.com/) where I worked for five years.

In 2020, with the band _The Unriders_ we also have recorded a hip-hop album about Munich, called [Мюнхен](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9fTO_KBt6A) (you can find it on Spotify / Apple Music / ... as well).
