Starting from 2003, I work as a FrontEnd & Software Developer, but that's since even earlier I discovered that developing user interfaces or quite anything visual and interactive, is my passion.
I often preferred programming to gaming or watching TV or going outside (not to the extent, though, or else how would I find friends?).

It is thanks to this feeling of discovering something new and creating something new from the small little logical and mathematical parts, making something beautiful, appealing, friendly, and useful.

So during my work experience I developed many complex components, such as Treemap (or BinPacking) component for monitoring stocks implemented in Delphi, or the interface for Fast Fourier analysis of seismic signal in Borland C++,
or the UI for first neural networks with no more than a dozen layers of neurons (or else your PC take weeks to compute them), then using now-forgotten protocols (e.g. Google Wave aka Federation One) for delivering immersive and friendly chat experience, then it would be JavaScript player for web animation tool Animatron,
and through years it got me into developing generative art both with JavaScript + GLSL, as well as functional programming languages in JetBrains on marketing purposes, so that design team wouldn't be required to manually produce all the variants of art, but just to overlook and rule the generation process.

From all this it could look like I loved mathematics all the way, but at the start I really didn't, and only now I find its laws everywhere around, including music, geometry, or theorem proving.

Of course, there were Java EE or GWT or React-driven application, and even Python was among my skills.


## Skills

## Timeline

### JetBrains GmbH {#jetbrains}
**FrontEnd & Software Developer**

May 2016 — August 2024

  - [jetbrains.com](https://jetbrains.com)
  - [Computational Arts Initiative @ JetBrains](https://cai.jetbrains.com)
  - [Developers Survey @ JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/)

In JetBrains, I mostly worked in Computational Arts Initiative, which is the team we formed by accident with the designer Serg Golovachev, with whom we've met while working in Animatron.

The purpose of the team is helping designers get rid of the repetitive tasks where marketing requires tons of variations of the same approaches. The technologies differed vastly between projects and years, always it was something with the Web Frontend though.
If you ever used JetBrains IDEs then you there's a chance seen the splash screens produced by us or our folks from the CAI team, after the approve or even polishing by the Design Team, of course, or may be a background of some YouTube video telling your about Tips & Tricks in those IDEs.
You can visit and try web versions of the generators yourself if you follow the link to the CAI below.

Aside from that, I was doing FrontEnd development for jetbrains.com website, some landing pages, or for example, some years of Developers Survey (2017 & 2018) are produced by yours FrontEnd Team representative in collaboration with designers.

### Animatron LLC {#animatron}
**GWT/JS Developer**

July 2011 — May 2016

  - [Animatron Web Editor](https://animatron.com)
  - [Animatron JS Player @ GitHub](https://github.com/Animatron/player)
  - [Animatron JS Player Docs & Sandbox](https://animatron.github.io/player/)

At Animatron, I mostly developed the Web Player based on HTML5 Canvas technology, in pure vanilla JavaScript. Designing a friendly API was one of my tasks, bit not as important as integrating the player into the main GWT-Based Application so that it would reproduce properly and perfectly every feature that the Animation Editor had. That required some GWT coding too. Still, the player also could be used standalone and be embedded into websites, and has a sandbox with the code editor to provide user with an easy way to develop scenes.

I am fortunate that the Team-Leads and folks from the company convinced my to give my first public talk on my knowledge which further really helped me in finding next places to work and led to Animatron & JetBrains in the end.

**Java EE Developer**
**JavaScript Web UI Developer**

June 2007 — June 2009

  - [myPictureTown](https://mypicturetown.com)

In FotoNation, we developed photo sharing service for Nikon, one of the very first of its kind. At that time, Nikon had released their first Photo Cameras with Wi-Fi support. I worked in the UI Team, responsible both for Java & JavaScript on the FrontEnd, the hardest were the Gallery page and the individual Photo viewer, like including Drag & Drop of images from the file system while there were almost no solutions for it at the time, beating Time Zones and other challenges.

Action System for the UI was the idea and implementation of ours since technologies we used provided no friendly and easy approach. // Development with Apache Wicket + JavaScript ‐ complex native‐JS+Java components and layouting scripts + action system, UI prototypes using JQuery. Components/Layouts are dynamically communicate with server‐side/Database.

of Ajax-based Web UI as well as server-side Java code
for myPictureTown service. His knowledge of web technologies and languages, such
as Javascript+Ajax, HTML, CSS are on the expert
level. He is a reliable, hard-working professional, and
I recommend him without reservations. -- Boris Berkman
> I know Anton as a brilliant Javascript programmer with strong understanding of the most advanced concepts of this language. His Java skills are also allow him to write good Java code. It is a pleasure to work with such talented professional. -- Sergey Kusnetsov

﴾Ajax, JSF, Spring/Hibernate﴿, what used to do before, and keep doing till today. One of the main projects was UnlockAustin, which was a platform for introducing people the musical and theatrical events (but not only those) happening in Austin, Texas.
Could be that Austin is a popular city nowadays due to this web portal :D.
I also developed Delphi Visual Component for Stock monitoring (with realtime/dynamic data visualization support) using TreeMap Algorithm to be integrated into the client desktop application;
Dealing with threads concurrency and a high rate of updates;

March 2003 — March 2005

  - [VNIIO : Science Department](https://vniio.ru/about/science_dept/)
  - [The University Website](https://www.вниио.рф)

By chance, I got to work at the GeoPhysics University at my age of 19, thanks to the friend. Among the work at the site, we did several travels with camping and monitoring seismic waves in real-time.
The purpose was to predict earthquakes so that people would be aware in advance or would know if it is safe to build bridges at place.
I developed the UI for calculating and configuring Fast Fourier Transform of the raw signal so that significant peaks would be easily noticable on the graphics. At the time I didn't know how significant this algorithm is in almost every technology (like breaking audio into harmonics, actually the same we did here, or converting digital pictures to their vector counterpart keeping almost the perfect representation of the form), but now I do.
Also, it happend that someone noticed I know how to use Macromedia Flash and our Head of Science asked me to provide a friendly and descriptive animation of the tectonic plates colliding for his talks. After all, he invited me to be a guest of his talk with this animation in Arkhangelsk and hired the professional Animator to teach me further.

@ [Lambda Meetup @ JetBrains ('tail 23)](https://www.meetup.com/munich-lambda/events/296915834/). Munich, Germany

How we can use waves a base for generating both audio or static graphics or video or something else, on the example of oscillators, how generic its concept is, and how in the end everything is a wave (and a monad!).

in 2022

@ JetBrains Design Talks '22. Munich, Germany

The talk was a part of the next iteration of design talks from our company, and company helped a lot in its recording, but its production was finished later and its public promotion was cancelled due to the world-turning event such as declaring war by my own country, so we had no emotional/moral resources as well as reasons to proceed with it.
