Starting from 2003, I work as a FrontEnd & Software Developer, but that's since even earlier I discovered that developing user interfaces or quite anything visual and interactive, is my passion.
I often preferred programming to gaming or watching TV or going outside (not to the extent, though, or else how would I find friends?).

It is thanks to this feeling of discovering something new and creating something new from the small little logical and mathematical parts, making something beautiful, appealing, friendly, and useful.

So during my work experience I developed many complex components, such as Treemap (or BinPacking) component for monitoring stocks implemented in Delphi, or the interface for Fast Fourier analysis of seismic signal in Borland C++,
or the UI for first neural networks with no more than a dozen layers of neurons, or else your PC take weeks to compute them, then using now-forgotten protocols (e.g. Google Wave aka Federation One) for delivering immersive and friendly chat experience, then it would be JavaScript player for web animation tool Animatron,
and through years it got me into developing generative art with functional programming languages in JetBrains for marketing purposes, so that design team wouldn't be required to manually produce all the variants of art, but just to overlook and rule the generation process.

From all this it could look like I loved mathematics all the way, but at the start I really didn't, and only now I find its laws everywhere around, including music, geometry, or theorem proving.


## Timeline

### JetBrains GmbH {#jetbrains}
**FrontEnd & Software Developer**

May 2016 — August 2024

In JetBrains, I mostly worked in Computational Arts Initiative, which is the team we formed by accident with the designer Serg Golovachev, with whom we've met while working in Animatron.

The purpose of the team is helping designers get rid of the repetitive tasks where marketing requires tons of variations of the same approaches. The technologies differed vastly between projects and years, always it was something with the Web Frontend though.
If you ever used JetBrains IDEs then you there's a chance seen the splash screens produced by us or our folks from the CAI team, after the approve or even polishing by the Design Team, of course, or may be a background of some YouTube video telling your about Tips & Tricks in those IDEs.
You can visit and try web versions of the generators yourself if you follow the link to the CAI below.

Aside from that, I was doing FrontEnd development for jetbrains.com website, some landing pages, or for example, some years of Developers Survey (2017 & 2018) are produced by yours FrontEnd Team representative in collaboration with designers.


  - *Munich*, *Germany* 

Technologies:
:  JavaScript, React, Elm, HTML5 Canvas, GLSL Shaders, d3.js, Kotlin JS, Kotlin, DHall, PureScript
### Animatron LLC {#animatron}
**GWT/JS Developer**

July 2011 — May 2016

At Animatron, I mostly developed the Web Player based on HTML5 Canvas technology, in pure vanilla JavaScript. Designing a friendly API was one of my tasks, bit not as important as integrating the player into the main GWT-Based Application so that it would reproduce properly and perfectly every feature that the Animation Editor had. That required some GWT coding too. Still, the player also could be used standalone and be embedded into websites, and has a sandbox with the code editor to provide user with an easy way to develop scenes.

  - *Munich*, *Germany* 2012 — 2016 *(JetBrains GmbH)*
  - *Odessa*, *Ukraine* 2011 — 2012
  - *Boston*, *United States, MA* 

Technologies:

### iPark Ventures {#ipark}
**GWT Developer**

April 2010 — June 2011

Programming and Architecture with GWT ﴾with mvp4g﴿, writing custom components. We developed two web portals: one for job-searchers and HRs, and another one is for pet-owners searching for the medical care or shelter or just to discuss general topics regarding their domestic animals. I am fortunate that the Team-Leads and folks from the company convinced my to give my first public talk on my knowledge which further really helped me in finding next places to work and led to Animatron & JetBrains in the end.

  - *Odessa*, *Ukraine* 

Technologies:
:  Java, Google Web Toolkit (GWT), mvp4g GWT Framework, JavaScript, Python
### Exectum LLC {#exectum}
**Java EE / Web Developer**

October 2009 — February 2010

The ExtJS-based FrontEnd for the Administration of a Billing Engine, which communicated to the server using Java-RPC.

  - *St. Petersburg*, *Russia*

Project, related to the sea machinery documentation. Just one month, so almost nothing!

  - *St. Petersburg*, *Russia* 

Technologies:
:  Java, Java EE, XML, XSLT, JavaScript
### FotoNation / Piclinq {#fotonation}
**Java EE Developer**
**JavaScript Web UI Developer**

June 2007 — June 2009

In FotoNation, we developed photo sharing service for Nikon, one of the very first of its kind. At that time, Nikon had released their first Photo Cameras with Wi-Fi support. I worked in the UI Team, responsible both for Java & JavaScript on the FrontEnd, the hardest were the Gallery page and the individual Photo viewer, like including Drag & Drop of images from the file system while there were almost no solutions for it at the time, beating Time Zones and other challenges.

Action System for the UI was the idea and implementation of ours since technologies we used provided no friendly and easy approach. // Development with Apache Wicket + JavaScript ‐ complex native‐JS+Java components and layouting scripts + action system, UI prototypes using JQuery. Components/Layouts are dynamically communicate with server‐side/Database.

  - *St. Petersburg*, *Russia* 

Technologies:

### FK LTD {#fk-ltd}

  - *St. Petersburg*, *Russia* 

Technologies:
:  PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, XML
### EmDev LLC {#emdev-llc}
**Software / Web Developer**

March 2005 — October 2006

Mostly driven by outsourcing, in this company I participated in J2EE Projects ﴾Spring, Hibernate﴿ from the scratch, writing components, usually trying out and using new technologies
﴾Ajax, JSF, Spring/Hibernate﴿, what used to do before, and keep doing till today. One of the main projects was UnlockAustin, which was a platform for introducing people the musical and theatrical events (but not only those) happening in Austin, Texas.
Could be that Austin is a popular city nowadays due to this web portal :D.
I also developed Delphi Visual Component for Stock monitoring (with realtime/dynamic data visualization support) using TreeMap Algorithm to be integrated into the client desktop application;
Dealing with threads concurrency and a high rate of updates;

  - *St. Petersburg*, *Russia* 

Technologies:
:  Java, Java EE, Enterprise Java Beans, Java Server Pages, Java Server Faces, Spring, Hibernate, Borland Delphi, Python
### FSBI "VNII Okeangeologia" {#vniio}
**Software Developer**
**Animation Creator for Conferences**
**Scientific Researcher**
**Interpreter**

March 2003 — March 2005

By chance, I got to work at the GeoPhysics University at my age of 19, thanks to the friend. Among the work at the site, we did several travels with camping and monitoring seismic waves in real-time.
The purpose was to predict earthquakes so that people would be aware in advance or would know if it is safe to build bridges at place.
I developed the UI for calculating and configuring Fast Fourier Transform of the raw signal so that significant peaks would be easily noticable on the graphics. At the time I didn't know how significant this algorithm is in almost every technology (like breaking audio into harmonics, actually the same we did here, or converting digital pictures to their vector counterpart keeping almost the perfect representation of the form), but now I do.
Also, it happend that someone noticed I know how to use Macromedia Flash and our Head of Science asked me to provide a friendly and descriptive animation of the tectonic plates colliding for his talks. After all, he invited me to be a guest of his talk with this animation in Arkhangelsk and hired the professional Animator to teach me further.
