At Animatron, I mostly developed the Web Player based on HTML5 Canvas technology, in pure vanilla JavaScript. Designing a friendly API was one of my tasks, bit not as important as integrating the player into the main GWT-Based Application so that it would reproduce properly and perfectly every feature that the Animation Editor had. That required some GWT coding too. Still, the player also could be used standalone and be embedded into websites, and has a sandbox with the code editor to provide user with an easy way to develop scenes.
