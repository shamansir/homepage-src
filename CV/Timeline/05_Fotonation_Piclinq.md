In FotoNation, we developed photo sharing service for Nikon, one of the very first of its kind. At that time, Nikon had released their first Photo Cameras with Wi-Fi support. I worked in the UI Team, responsible both for Java & JavaScript on the FrontEnd, the hardest were the Gallery page and the individual Photo viewer, like including Drag & Drop of images from the file system while there were almost no solutions for it at the time, beating Time Zones and other challenges.

Action System for the UI was the idea and implementation of ours since technologies we used provided no friendly and easy approach. // Development with Apache Wicket + JavaScript ‐ complex native‐JS+Java components and layouting scripts + action system, UI prototypes using JQuery. Components/Layouts are dynamically communicate with server‐side/Database.
