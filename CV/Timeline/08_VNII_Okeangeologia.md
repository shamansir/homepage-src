By chance, I got to work at the GeoPhysics University at my age of 19, thanks to the friend. Among the work at the site, we did several travels with camping and monitoring seismic waves in real-time.
The purpose was to predict earthquakes so that people would be aware in advance or would know if it is safe to build bridges at place.
I developed the UI for calculating and configuring Fast Fourier Transform of the raw signal so that significant peaks would be easily noticable on the graphics. At the time I didn't know how significant this algorithm is in almost every technology (like breaking audio into harmonics, actually the same we did here, or converting digital pictures to their vector counterpart keeping almost the perfect representation of the form), but now I do.
Also, it happend that someone noticed I know how to use Macromedia Flash and our Head of Science asked me to provide a friendly and descriptive animation of the tectonic plates colliding for his talks. After all, he invited me to be a guest of his talk with this animation in Arkhangelsk and hired the professional Animator to teach me further.
