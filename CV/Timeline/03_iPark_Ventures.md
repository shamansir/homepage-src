**GWT Developer**

April 2010 — June 2011

Programming and Architecture with GWT ﴾with mvp4g﴿, writing custom components. We developed two web portals: one for job-searchers and HRs, and another one is for pet-owners searching for the medical care or shelter or just to discuss general topics regarding their domestic animals. I am fortunate that the Team-Leads and folks from the company convinced my to give my first public talk on my knowledge which further really helped me in finding next places to work and led to Animatron & JetBrains in the end.
