In JetBrains, I mostly worked in Computational Arts Initiative, which is the team we formed by accident with the designer Serg Golovachev, with whom we've met while working in Animatron.

The purpose of the team is helping designers get rid of the repetitive tasks where marketing requires tons of variations of the same approaches. The technologies differed vastly between projects and years, always it was something with the Web Frontend though.
If you ever used JetBrains IDEs then you there's a chance seen the splash screens produced by us or our folks from the CAI team, after the approve or even polishing by the Design Team, of course, or may be a background of some YouTube video telling your about Tips & Tricks in those IDEs.
You can visit and try web versions of the generators yourself if you follow the link to the CAI below.

Aside from that, I was doing FrontEnd development for jetbrains.com website, some landing pages, or for example, some years of Developers Survey (2017 & 2018) are produced by yours FrontEnd Team representative in collaboration with designers.
