Mostly driven by outsourcing, in this company I participated in J2EE Projects ﴾Spring, Hibernate﴿ from the scratch, writing components, usually trying out and using new technologies
﴾Ajax, JSF, Spring/Hibernate﴿, what used to do before, and keep doing till today. One of the main projects was UnlockAustin, which was a platform for introducing people the musical and theatrical events (but not only those) happening in Austin, Texas.
Could be that Austin is a popular city nowadays due to this web portal :D.
I also developed Delphi Visual Component for Stock monitoring (with realtime/dynamic data visualization support) using TreeMap Algorithm to be integrated into the client desktop application;
Dealing with threads concurrency and a high rate of updates;
