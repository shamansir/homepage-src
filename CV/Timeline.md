  - [Computational Arts Initiative @ JetBrains](https://cai.jetbrains.com)
  - [Developers Survey @ JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/)

In JetBrains, I mostly worked in Computational Arts Initiative, which is the team we formed by accident with the designer Serg Golovachev, with whom we've met while working in Animatron.

The purpose of the team is helping designers get rid of the repetitive tasks where marketing requires tons of variations of the same approaches. The technologies differed vastly between projects and years, always it was something with the Web Frontend though.
If you ever used JetBrains IDEs then you there's a chance seen the splash screens produced by us or our folks from the CAI team, after the approve or even polishing by the Design Team, of course, or may be a background of some YouTube video telling your about Tips & Tricks in those IDEs.
You can visit and try web versions of the generators yourself if you follow the link to the CAI below.

Aside from that, I was doing FrontEnd development for jetbrains.com website, some landing pages, or for example, some years of Developers Survey (2017 & 2018) are produced by yours FrontEnd Team representative in collaboration with designers.

### Animatron LLC {#animatron}
**GWT/JS Developer**

July 2011 — May 2016

  - [Animatron Web Editor](https://animatron.com)
  - [Animatron JS Player @ GitHub](https://github.com/Animatron/player)
  - [Animatron JS Player Docs & Sandbox](https://animatron.github.io/player/)

At Animatron, I mostly developed the Web Player based on HTML5 Canvas technology, in pure vanilla JavaScript. Designing a friendly API was one of my tasks, bit not as important as integrating the player into the main GWT-Based Application so that it would reproduce properly and perfectly every feature that the Animation Editor had. That required some GWT coding too. Still, the player also could be used standalone and be embedded into websites, and has a sandbox with the code editor to provide user with an easy way to develop scenes.

I am fortunate that the Team-Leads and folks from the company convinced my to give my first public talk on my knowledge which further really helped me in finding next places to work and led to Animatron & JetBrains in the end.

### FotoNation / Piclinq {#fotonation}
**Java EE Developer**
**JavaScript Web UI Developer**

June 2007 — June 2009

  - [myPictureTown](https://mypicturetown.com)

In FotoNation, we developed photo sharing service for Nikon, one of the very first of its kind. At that time, Nikon had released their first Photo Cameras with Wi-Fi support. I worked in the UI Team, responsible both for Java & JavaScript on the FrontEnd, the hardest were the Gallery page and the individual Photo viewer, like including Drag & Drop of images from the file system while there were almost no solutions for it at the time, beating Time Zones and other challenges.

Action System for the UI was the idea and implementation of ours since technologies we used provided no friendly and easy approach. // Development with Apache Wicket + JavaScript ‐ complex native‐JS+Java components and layouting scripts + action system, UI prototypes using JQuery. Components/Layouts are dynamically communicate with server‐side/Database.

﴾Ajax, JSF, Spring/Hibernate﴿, what used to do before, and keep doing till today. One of the main projects was UnlockAustin, which was a platform for introducing people the musical and theatrical events (but not only those) happening in Austin, Texas.
Could be that Austin is a popular city nowadays due to this web portal :D.

### FSBI VNII Okeangeologia {#vniio}
**Software Developer**
**Animation Creator for Conferences**
**Scientific Researcher**
**Interpreter**

March 2003 — March 2005

  - [VNIIO : Science Department](https://vniio.ru/about/science_dept/)
  - [The University Website](https://www.вниио.рф)

By chance, I got to work at the GeoPhysics University at my age of 19, thanks to the friend. Among the work at the site, we did several travels with camping and monitoring seismic waves in real-time.
The purpose was to predict earthquakes so that people would be aware in advance or would know if it is safe to build bridges at place.
I developed the UI for calculating and configuring Fast Fourier Transform of the raw signal so that significant peaks would be easily noticable on the graphics. At the time I didn't know how significant this algorithm is in almost every technology (like breaking audio into harmonics, actually the same we did here, or converting digital pictures to their vector counterpart keeping almost the perfect representation of the form), but now I do.
Also, it happend that someone noticed I know how to use Macromedia Flash and our Head of Science asked me to provide a friendly and descriptive animation of the tectonic plates colliding for his talks. After all, he invited me to be a guest of his talk with this animation in Arkhangelsk and hired the professional Animator to teach me further.
