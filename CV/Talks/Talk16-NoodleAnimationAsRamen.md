### Noodle : Animation as Ramen {#noodle-jb}

in 2022

@ JetBrains Design Talks '22. Munich, Germany

This talk was recorded during Covid and is about my project Noodle, for visual programming, which is the next version of RPD and now is in the development. The talk was a part of the next iteration of design talks from our company, and company helped a lot in its recording, but its production was finished later and its public promotion was cancelled due to the world-turning event such as declaring war by my own country, so we had no emotional/moral resources as well as reasons to proceed with it.
