### PureScript with a chance of Free Monads {#purs-free-monads}

in 2023

@ [Lambda Meetup @ JetBrains ('head 23)](https://www.meetup.com/munich-lambda/events/289723656/?eventOrigin=group_past_events). Munich, Germany

This talk describes the use of Free Monad concept in the core of Noodle project of mine. The pros and cons of Free Monads are yet discussed a lot, but in my case they really helped in abstracting concepts while keeping the code user-friendly.
