### Fluxus {#fluxus}

April 2011

@ [Application Developer Days (ADD)](https://addconf.ru/en/program/12587). St. Peterburg, Russia

Fluxus is the visual tool for developing interactive three-dimensional visuals, for example to react on music. It uses Scheme / Racket stack over OpenGL backend. This talk shares my inspiration with it and demonstrates features of the engine. However, my Jack (not a person, but audio Linux driver) failed at the time of talk, so there was no audio to rely on.
