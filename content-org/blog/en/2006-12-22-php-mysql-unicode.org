It is [[http://live.julik.nl/2005/03/unicode-php][not the advice of
mine]], but it helped me enormously.

I've to accomplish the state when all of my pages are in =UTF-8=
encoding, but the DB is also OK.

That's what helped me - combining this advice with one line in =PHP=
code while connecting to the DB

=MySQL= + =Apache= + =PHP= + =mb_string= :)

In mysql, following to =PHPMyAdmin= everything was set to =utf-8=. But I
had to correct this line in database connection line:

#+begin_src php

mysql_select_db("****") and mysql_query("set names utf8") and
mysql_query("SET collation_connection = 'utf8_general_ci'");
#+end_src

Then I've added inside all =.htaccess= files of all =html=/=php= folders
(why I am doing these strange things -
[[http://live.julik.nl/2005/03/unicode-php][in that advise]]) the next
lines:

#+begin_src apache

# unicode support
AddDefaultCharset utf-8
<IfModule mod_charset.c>
   CharsetDisable on
   CharsetRecodeMultipartForms Off
</IfModule>

php_value       mbstring.func_overload  7
php_value       default_charset         UTF-8
php_value       mbstring.language       Russian

php_value       mbstring.internal_encoding      UTF-8
php_flag        mbstring.encoding_translation   on
php_value       mbstring.http_input     "UTF-8,KOI8-R,CP1251"
php_value       mbstring.http_output    UTF-8
php_value       mbstring.detect_order   "UTF-8,KOI8-R,CP1251"
# end
#+end_src

And, of course, I've re-encoded all my pages and =php=-files in =UTF-8=
(used [[http://www.pspad.com/][PSPad]]).

And in =HTML=-pages I've added this, just be on the safe side:

#+begin_src html

<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
</head>
#+end_src

And everything started to work great and in =UTF-8=! (this method was
used in next post)
