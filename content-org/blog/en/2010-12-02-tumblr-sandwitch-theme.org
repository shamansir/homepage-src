Have created [[http://www.tumblr.com/theme/18012][Tumblr theme]] named
[[http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Sandwitch][Sandwitch]]. I was going
to make tumblr-blog look like
[[http://code.google.com/p/showdown-blog/][showdown blog]]-engine style
I've made, and seems the result in the end is even better!

You can turn on tweets translation, allow [[http://disqus.com][Disqus]]
comments and... write posts with source code highlighting!

To use source code highlighting it is required to make first line in
your code blocks to be something like =#!xml=, so I recommend to write
them using =Markdown=-edtior (it can be selected in your
[[http://www.tumblr.com/preferences][profile preferences]]).
[[http://shjs.sourceforge.net/][SHJS]] (copied to =static.tumblr=) is
used to make it work. You also must specify programming languages used
in blog manually (not just by checking "Highlight code" checkbox) in the
sort of: =['html','css','xml','javascript','java','python','sh']=. The
languages you can enable are: =html= (HTML), =xml= (XML), =css= (CSS),
=javascript= (JavaScript), =python= (Python), =java= (Java), =ruby=
(Ruby), =sql= (SQL), =sh= (Unix Shell), =php= (PHP), =cpp= (C++),
=csharp= (C#).

To translate tweets, set your "Twitter username" at
[[http://www.tumblr.com/customize][theme customization]].

To turn on [[http://disqus.com][Disqus]], set your "Disqus shortname" at
the [[http://www.tumblr.com/customize][very same settings]].
