**** Who I am
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: who-i-am
:END:
At work, I am JavaEE/Web developer. I like to develop client side: UI
controls, visual representation of the server data, server to client
(and back) data transfer and everything connected with that. Because of
this, I am also experienced in JavaScript (with JQuery usage or without)
and AJAX technologies (XML/JSON included). I like Java for its
considered strictness and serious, technological approach. I also pay
respect to [[http://webstandards.org/][Web Standards]]. JavaScript in
its current condition is the Web language with its own culture, now it
is an easy language to do dynamic and fun things on the pages. Of
course, my skills is not limited with described ones, but these
enumerated are the best in me :).

Here's my [[http://www.linkedin.com/in/shamansir][LinkedIn public
profile]]. I've participated in many projects, they're described there,
but to mention the huge ones, these are:
[[http://mypicturetown.com/][MyPicturetown]] and
[[http://unlockaustin.com/][UnlockAustin]]. I have a five-year
experience as developer.

At home, I like everything connected to CG. I like to use at most
Free/Open Source software, so my OS is preferably Linux/Ubuntu. And
that's because, I consider I must pay something to Open Source
community. I have several small projects, most of them are just
unfinished ideas, the notable ones are
[[http://code.google.com/p/nijiato/][=nijiato=]] (/Fingers motion
detection driven by Lisp/),
[[http://code.google.com/p/sametimed/][=sametimed= project]] (/Google
Wave/ Web Client) and
[[http://code.google.com/p/showdown-blog/][=showdown blog=]] (/Blog
engine written in just XML and JS/). I'm training my skills in Python,
my favorite programming language, and in Web development at the same
time. Also I have managed and participated in
[[http://ru.wikibooks.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_Python][translation
of Python Documentation]] to Russian language. To see all the stuff I am
doing, visit my [[http://code.google.com/u/shaman.sir/][googlecode
profile]] and [[https://launchpad.net/~shaman-sir][profile at
launchpad]].

I am trying to write the articles [[http://shamansir.tumblr.com][in my
blog]] about the new things I find and getting to know (they call it
=knowledge transfer=). In past times I've written posts a little bit
rarely, but I'm trying to fill it up. And I am writing more to my
russian version of the blog and just putting the translation later here.
